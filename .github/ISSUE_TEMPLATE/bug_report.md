2. Perform action `...` (e.g., load asset, change material, start simulation)
3. Observe issue `...`

**Expected Behavior**  
Describe what you expected to happen.

**Actual Behavior**  
Describe what actually happens (e.g., crash, freeze, visual artifact, incorrect physics behavior).

**Logs / Console Output**  
Attach any relevant output from the Venta Engine console or JVM:
- Stack traces
- `venta.log`
- JVM exceptions or GC warnings

**System Information**
- OS: [e.g. Windows 11 / Ubuntu 24.04 / macOS 14]
